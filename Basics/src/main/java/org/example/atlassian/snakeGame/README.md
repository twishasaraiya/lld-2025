Game of Snakes  
Remember the old phone game of snake? The snake can move up, down, left or right in a 2Dimensional board of arbitrary size.  
Lets try to pmplement the bae logic of this game  
Rules:  
• Every time moveSnake() is called, the snake moves up, down, left or right  
• The snake’s initial size is 3 and grows by 1 every 5 moves  
• The game ends when the snake hits itself

We can use the following as a starting point (pseudo-code):  
Interface SnakeGame {  
moveSnake(snakeDirection);  
isGameOver();  
}

Proposed Changes  
Change#1  
Make scale-up 2 optional  
Remove scale-up 2 completely  
Change#2  
Add new optional scale up: snake grows when it eats food rather than every 5 moves. Food is dropped at a random position on the board.
