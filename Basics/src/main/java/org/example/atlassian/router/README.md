Middleware Router  
a) We want to implement a middleware router for our web service, which based on the path returns different strings  
Our interface for the router looks something like:

```
Interface Router {  
Fun addRoute(path: String, result: String) : Unit;  
Fun callRoute(path:String) :String;  
}

Usage:  
Router.addRoute(“/bar” , “result)  
Router.callRoute(“/bar”) -> “result”

```

	Scale Up 1 – Wildcards using ordered checking  
        /foo/*/bar -> result1 
        /foo/* -> 
	Scale Up 2 – PathParams
