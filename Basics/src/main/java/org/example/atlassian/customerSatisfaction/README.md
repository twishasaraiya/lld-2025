Customer Satisfaction  
a) Imagine we have a customer support ticketing system. The system allows customers to rate the support agent out of 5. To start with, write a function which accepts a rating, and another which will show me all of the agents and the average ratingeach one has received, ordered highest to lowest.  
b) Currently your solution does not account for what happens if two agents have the same average rating. What options are there for handling ties and how can we implement that in code?  
c) Now I want to be able to see who the best agents are each month. Change the implementation so I can get that information.  
d) Write a new function that will allow me to export of each agentâ€™s average ratings per month. You can export in any format you like- for example csv,json or xml.  
e) Make it return the average ratings unsorted./ Make it return the total rating for each agent without the average
